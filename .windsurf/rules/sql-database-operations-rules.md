- If any activity requires SQL, postgressSQL, mySQL, SQLite, SQL-92, or similar database activities, write out each command/query for me to manually run my own database platform. Also combine all SQL commands/queries and append them to single markdown file at "/docs/SQL-OPERATIONS.md" that writes comments for each SQL command/query and places the SQL commands/queries in Markdown fenced code blocks with the language set to SQL. Collectively, this file should be able to be used to rebuild the whole data structure from zero.
- Whatever queries change the database structure, you will provide the rollback queries.
- Whenever prompted to make changes to databases, always me if you should create a backup first.
